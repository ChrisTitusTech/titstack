## Current phase: Enforced repository governance

- [ ] Configure a default-branch ruleset after CI check names exist remotely.
- [ ] Require pull requests, successful validation, and conversation resolution.
- [ ] Require an independent approval when repository ownership permits it.

## Completion rule

Move current-phase tasks to completed only after their acceptance criteria and
required validation pass. Keep external GitHub settings pending until verified
through the live repository.
